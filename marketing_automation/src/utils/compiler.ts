            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-sans text-lg">Every single morning, it was the exact same disappointing story. I would glance into the bathroom mirror, only to see bloated cheeks, heavy puffy eyes, and a completely indistinct, water-logged jawline looking back closely.</p>
            
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-sans">I tried expensive gua sha tools, ice rollers, drinking gallons of water before bed, and sleeping elevated. Absolutely nothing worked to drain that waking fluid accumulation.</p>
            
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-sans font-bold text-brand">Then my natural health advisor told me about "Cortisol Water Trapping".</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-sans">As high stress levels trigger cortisol alerts, your capillary gates open, locking excess water pools directly under thin facial skin. Standard coffee caffeine actually exacerbates this process by triggering immediate adrenaline surges and cortisol spikes. You are essentially pouring fuel on the fluid fire.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8 font-sans">Vahdam India formulated a groundbreaking solution: blending premium state-of-origin Arabica beans with KSM-66 Ashwagandha. It buffers the cortisol shock, allowing the coffee's natural diuretic properties to drain excess water weight safely while boosting brain focus through Lion's Mane.</p>

        <div class="card p-6 bg-white">
          <h4 class="font-serif font-bold text-brand mb-2">How exactly does it help drain face puffiness?</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">When stress triggers cortisol spikes, your cells trap high amounts of water—usually under thin facial skin and cheeks. KSM-66 regulates and calms cortisol spikes, signaling your cells to release trapped fluid, while high-grade Arabica acts as an active diuretic to flush it quickly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card p-6 bg-white">
          <h4 class="font-serif font-bold text-brand mb-2">Does this coffee actually taste like mushrooms or herbal roots?</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Absolutely not! We engineered our extraction to be completely heat insoluble and flavor-masked. It tastes precisely like an exquisite, luxury, barista-level organic dark Arabica coffee with smooth cocoa undertones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card p-6 bg-white">
          <h4 class="font-serif font-bold text-brand mb-2">How do I receive the free electric frother wand?</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">The free battery-operated custom whisk is automatically packaged inside each Starter Kit (3-pack) order parcel. There are no promo codes required; our warehouse dispatches them directly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card p-6 bg-white">
          <h4 class="font-serif font-bold text-brand mb-2">Is there any risk of jitters or standard mid-day crashes?</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">None. The active calming compounds present in KSM66 Ashwagandha slow down the speed of caffeine absorption in your gut, distributing energy evenly for 6 robust hours without racing hearts or crash events.</p>
